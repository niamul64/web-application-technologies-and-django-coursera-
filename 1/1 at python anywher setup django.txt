goto: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ 
login
goto: console -> bash (it means: using  linux ) 
now follow the command from: https://www.dj4e.com/assn/dj4e_install.md



building application:
cd ~ # goinhg to home derectory
mkdir django_projects #making a folder for all django_projects
cd django_projects # changing directory to 
django-admin startproject mysite # making a django project 'mysite'


now,
You need to edit the file ~/django_projects/mysite/mysite/settings.py and change the allowed hosts line (around line 28) to be:
 ALLOWED_HOSTS = [ '*' ]

After editing the setings, goto the django project (mysite)
command : python manage.py check #use to check the project file
 



Adding new app, Polls Application (adding a app 'Polls' ):

cd ~/django_projects/mysite # goto django project
python3 manage.py startapp polls # creating app

add that new app to settings:(inside INSTALLED_APPS )
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'polls.apps.PollsConfig',
]


Write your first view
Letâ€™s write the first view. Open the file polls/views.py and put the following Python code in it:

goto -->  polls/views.py: 

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")


create urls.py file at 'polls' app
In the polls/urls.py file include the following code:


from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

Now,
The next step is to point the root URLconf at the polls.urls module.
In mysite/urls.py, add an import for django.urls.include and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list, so you have:

at main app's urls.py:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')), #pointing to app 'polls' urls.py
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]




now, instead of 'python manage.py runserver' we will use
'python manage.py check'

If there is any error the it will show here.
 

now goto: http://niamul64.pythonanywhere.com/polls/
check the website
